Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
   Distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    i) changes to the Program, and
    ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
"originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.

Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
are not Modified Works.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under
this Agreement either on a standalone basis or as part of its own
Contributions or its Combined Work, but excluding combinations that
are not Covered Works. For purposes of this Agreement, "Covered
Works" means the combination of the Contribution and the Program
that, when executed, perform the purpose intended by the
Contributor. The Contributor must Distribute the Program in
accordance with this Agreement. The Contributor must include a
notice in each copy of the Program indicating that the Program is
provided under this Agreement. The Contributor must add a notice
stating that the Contributor has provided the Program under this
Agreement. The Contributor must add the notices required under
Exhibit A. A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the
Program for additions or changes. Any Covered Work that the
Contributor Distributes must include a readable copy of the notice
required under Exhibit A, in at least one of the following places:
within the Program source code, in the license notice for the
Program, or as part of a derivative work of the Program. For
purposes of this Exhibit A, "notice" means the text of the notice
contained in the Program as delivered by the Contributor under this
Agreement, including any source code, and any documentation for the
Program, whether in a particular file or otherwise.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
use of the Program, a Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does
not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product
offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees
to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
"Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do
not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, and use the Program to provide a graphical user
interface to a third party. That Contributor must then make the
Commercial Contributor's source code available to the recipients
of that commercial product offering. The Commercial Contributor may
choose to distribute the Program in a commercial product offering
under this Agreement, but is not required to do so. If the Program
is distributed as part of a Commercial Product Offering, the
Commercial Contributor must make the source code of the Program
available to the recipients of the commercial product offering in
source code form. The Commercial Contributor must ensure that the
source code remains available in exactly the form it received
from the Contributor for the entire life of the commercial product
offering.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks
and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE
USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable
under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,
and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision
shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s),
then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of
this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all
Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees
to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any applicable licenses granted by Recipient relating to the
Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted
and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement
stands for the Eclipse Public License, version 2.0. The Agreement
can be found at https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of the Program give
you permission to combine or link the Program with independent
modules that produce an executable, regardless of the license terms
of those independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you
meet the requirements of this Agreement. You may act solely on
your own behalf, solely on your own responsibility, on your own
behalf and on your sole responsibility, to not duplicate,
modify, publically display, publicly perform, sublicense and
distribute the Program as it is, as a template, as a example,
but not as part of a product. You may create a Larger Work by
combining the Program with other code not covered by the terms
of this Agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single
product. In such a case, you must make sure the requirements of
this Agreement are fulfilled for the Program.

The name of the Program may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this Program without specific prior written
permission.
