# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Short record of every technical decision. Format per ADR: **Status · Context · Decision ·
Consequences**. One decision per file, captured once.

Behavioural decisions live as rules + BDD in the story docs, not here — an ADR is only added when it
isn't clear from a rule/BDD.
